;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This extension facilitates moving images from point A to point B.
;;
;; Point A (the source) can be:
;; 1. An image inside your browser that you can drag to Emacs.
;; 2. An image on your file system that you can drag to Emacs.
;; 3. A local or remote image address in kill-ring.
;;    Use the `org-download-yank' command for this.
;;    Remember that you can use "0 w" in `dired' to get an address.
;; 4. An screenshot taken using `gnome-screenshot' or `scrot' or `gm'.
;;    Use the `org-download-screenshot' command for this.
;;    Customize the backend with  `org-download-screenshot-method'.
;;
;; Point B (the target) is an Emacs `org-mode' buffer where the inline
;; link will be inserted.  Several customization options will determine
;; where exactly on the file system the file will be stored.
;;
;; They are:
;; `org-download-method':
;; a. 'attach => use `org-mode' attachment machinery
;; b. 'directory => construct the directory in two stages:
;;    1. first part of the folder name is:
;;       * either "." (current folder)
;;       * or `org-download-image-dir' (if it's not nil).
;;         `org-download-image-dir' becomes buffer-local when set,
;;         so each file can customize this value, e.g with:
;;         # -*- mode: Org; org-download-image-dir: "~/Pictures/foo"; -*-
;;    2. second part is:
;;       * `org-download-heading-lvl' is nil => ""
;;       * `org-download-heading-lvl' is n => the name of current
;;         heading with level n. Level count starts with 0,
;;         i.e. * is 0, ** is 1, *** is 2 etc.
;;         `org-download-heading-lvl' becomes buffer-local when set,
;;         so each file can customize this value, e.g with:
;;         # -*- mode: Org; org-download-heading-lvl: nil; -*-
;;
;; `org-download-timestamp':
;; optionally add a timestamp to the file name.
;;
;; Customize `org-download-backend' to choose between `url-retrieve'
;; (the default) or `wget' or `curl'.
